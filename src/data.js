      "This is a very simple app I built within 8 weeks of learning how to code. I used this app to increase my productivity at SelectQuote by over 30% during a time where the department was both backlogged and understaffed. The app includes all of the verbiage used in communication with clients, which I spent months refining and re-wording to get the desired results. Using the app reduces typos and mistakes, and reduces the time it takes to create questionnaires as they no longer require being typed by hand. A version of this is still being used by employees at SelectQuote to this day. I've included this project not as an example of 'great code' (definitely not!), but as an example of problem-solving, initiative, and making a real-world impact that ultimately saved the company money in the form of increased efficiency and not needing to replace employees.
